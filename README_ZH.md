# Introduction

# 简介

Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to
solve common problems when designing an application or system.

设计模式是正式的最佳实践，程序员在设计一个应用或者系统时可以用它来解决一些通用的问题。

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven
development paradigms.

设计模式通过被测试过的和证明过开发范例可以加速开发者的开发效率。

Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major
problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who
are familiar with the patterns.

重用设计模式可以帮助我们避免那些因为微小问题而引发大问题，同时它也可以让那些熟悉设计模式的编程者和架构师们提高代码的可读性。

# Getting started

# 如何开始

Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various
Programming/Software Design Principles.

在你潜入材料前，你需要对几种编程/软件的设计原则有所熟悉

All designs should be as simple as possible. You should start with KISS, YAGNI,
and Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work principles. Complexity and
patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical
extensibility.

所有的设计都应该尽量简单。你应该以KISS (保持简单直接，Keep it Simple Stupid),YAGNI(你不需要它,You Ain't Gonna Need It),和Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work(做最简单的事)的原则开始。复杂的设计模式仅在它被实践扩展需要的时候被介绍。

Once you are familiar with these concepts you can start drilling down into
patterns by any of the following approaches

一旦你对这些概念很熟悉后，你就可以通过下面的这些方式开始深入学习这些设计模式


 - Using difficulty tags, `Difficulty-Beginner`, `Difficulty-Intermediate` & `Difficulty-Expert`.
 - Using pattern categories, `Creational`, `Behavioral` and others.
 - Search for a specific pattern. Can't find one? Please report a new pattern [here](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/issues).

- 使用不同的标签，`低难度`，`中等难度`和`专家难度`

- 使用设计模式目录，`创建型模式`，`行为型模式` 或者其他模式
